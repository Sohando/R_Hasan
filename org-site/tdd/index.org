** Preface

While reading the **Clean Code**, I came to know about this term and felt the necessity of this in development life cycle. *TDD* has emerged as the savior in every of my git pull, newly introduced features that should not break the previous code base, and mores to mention.

** Introduction

*TDD* is the acronym for Test Driven Development. It's a RGR (Red-Green-Refactor) process where tests are written first before any logic is placed to solve the problem, as for the test will fail by default for lacking of logics. This is the *Red* state of TDD. Now our next goal becomes to write a program, may be an inefficient solution to the problem but that pass the cases. We are in the *Green* state mentioned in the acronym, now it's time to *Refactor* our code.
