## Preface {#preface}

While reading the ****Clean Code****, I came to know about this term and felt the necessity of this in development life cycle. **TDD** has emerged as the savior in every of my git pull, newly introduced features that should not break the previous code base, and mores to mention.


## Introduction {#introduction}

**TDD** is the acronym for Test Driven Development. It's a RGR (Red-Green-Refactor) process where tests are written first before any logic is placed to solve the problem, as for the test will fail by default for lacking of logics. This is the **Red** state of TDD. Now our next goal becomes to write a program, may be an inefficient solution to the problem but that pass the cases. We are in the **Green** state mentioned in the acronym, now it's time to **Refactor** our code.
